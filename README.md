Game of Life music generator

The concept is of making a biological/emergent type music generator which uses the the zero player game as input and accesses the sound library.
The sounds are then mixed parallely and each generation of evolution in pattern in the said game corresponds to a new mix.
The track created can be easily modified for various sound categories given in the database and the coherence is determined via equitemporal sections, which can be extended in the future.
